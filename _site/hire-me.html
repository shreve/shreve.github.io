<p>Hey there! My name‚Äôs Jacob. Thanks for looking into hiring me.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a programmer and amateur systems architect. My specialty is Ruby on Rails development and deployment.</p>

<p>I can help you identify and fix problems with your project, or just work on optimizing it to scale.
I particularly love caching, benchmarking performance, and progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>You can check out my <a href="https://github.com/shreve">Github</a> for some open-source project I‚Äôve worked on
or my <a href="/">resume</a> for previous professional work.</p>

<p>Email me to set up a call, and we‚Äôll talk about your project.</p>

<p>shreve [at] umich.edu</p>
