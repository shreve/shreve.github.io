    Hey there! My name's Jacob, and I run Shreve Industries, a software research and development company.

    <h3>Things I'm working on</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://wellopp.com/" title="Wellopp - Wellness = Opportunity">Wellopp</a>
        <p>
          I joined the Wellopp team in January 2016. I am currently the product lead of
          our SMS-based patient interaction tool, as well as a supporting developer on
          several of our other products.
        </p></li>

      <li><a href="http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/academics/undergrad/degrees/options">B.S.E. in Computer Science	from UMich</a>
        <p>
          Beginning Fall 2016, I started my junior year at the University of Michigan's school of engineering.
          By the time I finish, I'll have taken courses on discrete math, algorithms, cryptography, operating systems,
          networks, compilers, machine learning, and more.
        </p> </li>

      <li><a href="https://www.sugu.org" title="Sugu, the adult lifestyle brand">Sugu</a>
        <p>
          Sugu is my growing brand of adult lifestyle products and services. As of now, it's just me, so it's growing slow.
          What motivated me to start such an ambitious project was the lack of transparency, reputability, and frankly
          good design in all the different niche sites I found.<br>
          <em>Sugu stands for sex positivity, open information, and accessibility.</em>
        </p></li>

      <li><a href="https://www.sugutoys.com" title="Sugu Toys">Sugu Toys</a>
        <p>
          Sugu Toys is the first service from Sugu. As the name suggests, it's an online sex toy store. Furthering the
          message of sex positivity, our mantra is “We’re here to sell you sex toys and accessories because sex is awesome and you’re great.”
