# Hire Me

Hey there! My name's Jacob. Thanks for looking into hiring me.

I'm a programmer and amateur systems architect. My specialty is Ruby on Rails development and deployment.

I can help you identify and fix problems with your project, or just work on optimizing it to scale.
I particularly love caching, benchmarking performance, and progressive enhancement.

You can check out my [Github](https://github.com/shreve) for some open-source project I've worked on
or my [resume](/) for previous professional work.

Email me to set up a call, and we'll talk about your project.

shreve [at] umich.edu
