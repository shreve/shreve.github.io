  <p>
    Hey there! My name's Jacob, and <span class="strike">you can <a href="/hire-me" title="Hire Jacob Evan Shreve">hire me</a> now</span> I'm too damn busy to take on new work.
    <br>How do you like my site? It may be bare, but it's super accessible and lightweight.

  <h3>Get in touch with me</h3>

    You can email me (shreve [at] umich.edu) or tweet me (@_shreve).

  <h3>Things I'm working on</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://wellopp.com/" title="Wellopp - Wellness = Opportunity">Wellopp</a>
      <p>
        I joined the Wellopp team in January 2016. I am currently the product lead of
        our SMS-based patient interaction tool, as well as a supporting developer on
        several of our other products.
      </p></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/academics/undergrad/degrees/options">B.S.E in Electrical Engineering from UMich</a>
      <p>
        I'm also working on a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree. Beginning Fall 2016, I started my junior year at the University
        of Michigan's school of engineering. Once I complete the B.S.E. program, I also plan on continuing to acheive an M.S.E. in electrical
        and computer engineering. I may continue to the Ph.D. program just because I want people to have to call me “doctor” because I'm vain like that.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.sugu.org" title="Sugu, the adult lifestyle brand">Sugu</a>
      <p>
        Sugu is my growing brand of adult lifestyle products and services. As of now, it's just me, so it's growing slow.
        What motivated me to start such an ambitious project was the lack of transparency, reputability, and frankly
        good design in all the different niche sites I found.<br>
        <em>Sugu stands for sex positivity, open information, and accessibility.</em>
      </p></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.sugutoys.com" title="Sugu Toys">Sugu Toys</a>
      <p>
        Sugu Toys is the first service from Sugu. As the name suggests, it's an online sex toy store. Furthering the
        message of sex positivity, our mantra is “We’re here to sell you sex toys and accessories because sex is awesome and you’re great.”
      </p></li>
    <!--<li><a href="https://www.youcamp.com" title="Youcamp - Adventures on private land">Youcamp</a>
         <p>
         Youcamp is a community of landowners who welcome visitors wanting to use their land for camping, picnicing, or even holding
         large festivals. Run by James and Prue Woodford, Youcamp has been growing for several years. In response to their growth,
         they've begun working on a ground-up rebuild of their site. For the last year, I've been fixing up and maintaining the current
         platform, as I will continue to do until the new site is ready.
         </p></li>-->
      <li><a href="https://millerscreenworks.com" title="Miller Screenworks">Miller Screenworks</a>
        <p>
          Miller Screenworks is the informational site for a local screenprinting business. A few years ago, Glenn and Jill Miller
          came to me explaining that all the options they've tried for even as simple a site as theirs just sucked. All they wanted
          was a list of the products they recommend for printing on, and all the manufacturers' site builders came up short.
          With this task in mind, I designed and built their site from the ground up, much to their delight.
