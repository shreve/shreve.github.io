# Design System

This page exists to display every component of the design system for this
website. It's a place to show off what I've got, and to help design things with
some degree of appropriate context. Consider this a work in progress: something
cool to check out if you're a design nerd, but not anything of actual value.

## Headings

In this section, we've got every level of heading as well as subheadings for
front-matter on blog posts and such.

<header>
    <h1>H1: This is The Title of The Page or Post</h1>
    <div class="content-element">
        <span class="timestamps">
            Published 6th of August, 2020
        </span>
        <br>
        <span>
            <ul class="tags">
                <li>design</li>
                <li>demo</li>
                <li>design-system</li>
            </ul>
        </span>
    </div>
</header>

## H2: Section heading

### H3: Category heading

#### H4: What is this even for

##### H5: Getting there

###### H6: The smallest

That's it for headings. Probably for good reason, headings just don't look right
unless you have some content beneath them to break things up before the next heading.
